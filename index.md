## About

Received his B.S. degree (2011) in Telecommunications and Electronic Engineering from the Technological University of Havana, Cuba, and his M.Sc. degree (2019) in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Esp\'irito Santo, Brazil. He is currently working towards a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Esp\'irito Santo, cooperating with the UFES' SDN Research Group. His research interests include Software-Defined Networks, Wireless Networks and Network Performance.

## Research

### Projects

* High reliability in WiFi mobile access with software-defined multi-connectivity.
> The project proposes the use of multiple connectivity mechanisms in WiFi architectures through the use of software-defined networks (SDN) to obtain high-reliability communications without interruptions during the mobility of users.

* [FUTEBOL project](http://www.ict-futebol.org.br)
> Creation of a federated control framework to integrate testbeds from Europe and Brazil for network researchers for academia and industry. Participation on experimentation regarding fiber-wireless convergence to enable the remote real-time control of cloud-enabled robots application with high throughput and low latency requirements.
