## About

Received his B.S. degree (2011) in Telecommunications and Electronic Engineering from the Technological University of Havana, Cuba, and his M.Sc. degree (2019) in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Espírito Santo, Brazil. He is currently working towards a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Espírito Santo, cooperating with the UFES' SDN Research Group. His research interests include Software-Defined Networks, Wireless Networks and Network Performance.

"Intelligent Road Intersections: A Case for Time-Critical Digital Twins"
The analysis of all possible scenarios that may occur in an intersection involving various agents, such as vehicles and non-vehicles, is virtually impossible to be done to support traffic control centers decisions. In recent years, digital twins (DT) have become a viable solution to address complex problems when monitoring a physical asset along with the digitized representation of it. Thus, the Thesis proposes for the first time a data model for a DT that traffic control centers could use to analyze what-if scenarios to obtain quick and yet dependable answers and act accordingly to improve VRUs safety at road intersections. Therefore, a second contribution is how to model and address strict latency requirements imposed by the time-critical DTs, considering the competition for the underlying infrastructure faced by DTs. Last but not least, another contribution is expected when addressing the efficiency of the network and computing resources for such DTs-constrained time-critical deadlines.

"High reliability in WiFi mobile access with software-defined multi-connectivity."
The [Dissertation](https://ele.ufes.br/pt-br/pos-graduacao/PPGEE/detalhes-da-tese?id=12128) proposed the use of multiple connectivity mechanisms in WiFi architectures through the use of software-defined networks (SDN) to obtain high-reliability communications without interruptions during the mobility of users.

## Research

### Projects

* [FUTEBOL project](http://www.ict-futebol.org.br) (2017-2019)
> Creation of a federated control framework to integrate testbeds from Europe and Brazil for network researchers for academia and industry. Participation on experimentation regarding fiber-wireless convergence to enable the remote real-time control of cloud-enabled robots application with high throughput and low latency requirements. My work consists of developing a solution for high reliability in Wi-Fi mobile access with software-defined multi-connectivity.

* [Implementation and management of advanced communication network means and services](https://pop-es.rnp.br) (2020-present)
> The project aims to offer a continuous management, operation and maintenance service for the communication infrastructure and services provided by the Espírito Santo Presence Point - (PoP-ES) of the National Education and Research Network (RNP). My work at POP-ES is related to the implementation of open source private edge clouds for use in small provider scenarios, work on the design, operation and management of a LOKI architecture (Linux, Openstack, Kubernetes, Infrastructure).

* [Edge Computing for Road Intersection Digital Twins in Smart Cities](https://pop-es.rnp.br) (2021-present)
> With this project, it is expected that the digital twin will enable the monitoring, control and management of intelligent road intersections, improving the performance of these systems and providing safety for vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians and others vulnerable road users.
